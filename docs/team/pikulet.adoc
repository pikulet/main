== PROJECT: Concierge

---

== Overview

Concierge is a desktop hotel management application used as an all-in-one
platform for receptionists to handle potential bookings and current guests. The
user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It
is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

*Major enhancement*: added *the ability to login/logout* of the system

* What it does: Allow users to login to Concierge and access restricted
commands which mutate the data
* Significance:  With this feature, hotel managers can implement some level
of access control. By combining this with the ability to export the command
history, the auditing process for rogue commands is expedited.
* Highlights:
** The login/logout feature is dynamic and multiple logins/ logouts can
happen in the same session. What this means is that there is a very close
integration with the existing commands as there is a need to verify whether
these commands are restricted.
** This feature is complete - there was a need to work with the different
architectural components of Concierge, from command parsing (`Logic`) to login
verification (`Model`) and even password storage (`Storage`).
** The feature attempts to achieve some level of security as the passwords
are strong as a SHA-256 hash instead of in plaintext.
* Credits: The password hash algorithm was taken from https://www.baeldung.com/sha-256-hashing-java.

*Minor enhancements*:

* Renamed the existing classes and methods from `Person` to `Guest`
* Modified the `add` command to take in more parameters, namely the room and
date details) in a hotel booking. Note that the actual `Room` and `Booking`
modules were not done by me
* Modified the `clear` command to maintain empty hotel rooms. Previously,
`clear` removed all data
* Removed `address` as a field in `Person`
* Removed the `edit` and `delete` commands

*Project Management*:

* Set up RepoSense for the team
* Community
** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments):
** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (example:
