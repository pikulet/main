handle potential bookings and current guests. The user interacts with it
using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and
 has about 10 kLoC.

*Major enhancement*: added *the ability to login/logout* of the system. +

* What it does: Allows users to login to Concierge and access restricted
commands which mutate the data.
* Significance:  With this feature, hotel managers can implement some level
of access control. Some features more commonly used (`find`, `list`) can
still be accessed without signing in. By combining this with the ability
 to export the command history, the auditing process for rogue commands is
 expedited.
* Highlights:
** The login/logout feature is dynamic - the users are not prompted to sign in
upon starting Concierge, and users can logout and log back in within the same
 session. This means that there is a very close integration with the existing
  commands to verify the sign-in status and whether the commands require
  signing-in.
** This feature is complete - I worked with the different architectural
components of Concierge, from command parsing (`Logic`) to login verification
 (`Model`) and even password storage (`Storage`).
** The feature attempts to achieve some level of security with SHA-256
hashing.
* Credits: The password hash algorithm was taken from https://www.baeldung.com/sha-256-hashing-java.
* These features were mainly achieved in
