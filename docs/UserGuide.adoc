By: `Team Concierge(TM)`      Since: `Jun 2016`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

Concierge(TM) is created for *hotel managers and receptionists* of small hotels looking for a simple application to *assist
the user in hotel management*. More importantly, Concierge(TM) is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Concierge(TM) can get your
hotel management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `concierge.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Concierge(TM).
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list -r`* : lists all rooms
* **`checkin`**`r/001` : checks in the first booking of room 001
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Terminology]]
== Terminology
Some important things that you should know before using Concierge(TM)

====

* Room numbers must be a *3-digit number from 001 to 100*. For example,
** 001, 050, 074, 100 are valid
** 000, 01, 99, 101 are invalid

* The format used for dates is *d/M/y*, whereby
** `d` - Day can be 1 or 2 digits
** `M` - Month can be 1 or 2 digits
** `y` - Year can be 2 or 4 digits (if 2 digits, date is assumed to be in the current century)

* A `Booking` ...
** is *Active* if the period between its start and end date includes today's date, inclusively.
** is *Upcoming* if its start date is strictly after today's date.
** is *Expired* if its end date is strictly before today's date.
** is *Outdated* if its start date is strictly before today's date.
** is *Overlapping* with another booking if its start date is strictly before the other's end date AND the other's start date is strictly before its end date
** can be uniquely identified by its start date.

* There are 2 guest lists:
** *Checked-in guest list* contains all the guests who are currently checked-in.
** *Archived guest list* contains all guests who have ever stayed in the hotel before.
** Therefore, it is possible for a guest who has made a booking to be in
*** neither lists - guest has yet to check-in and has never stayed in the hotel before
*** checked-in guest list only - guest has checked-in and has never stayed in the hotel before
*** archived guest list only - guest has checked-in and has stayed in the hotel before
*** both lists - guest has checked-in and has stayed in the hotel before
