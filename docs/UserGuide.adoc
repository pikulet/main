== Introduction

Concierge is created for *hotel managers and receptionists* of small hotels looking for a simple application to *assist
the user in hotel management*. More importantly, Concierge is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Concierge can get your
hotel management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `concierge.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Concierge.
