== Introduction

Concierge is created for *hotel managers and receptionists* of small hotels looking for a simple application to *assist
the user in hotel management*. More importantly, Concierge is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Concierge can get your
hotel management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `concierge.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Concierge.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list -r`* : lists all rooms
* **`checkin`**`r/085` : checks in the first active booking of room 085
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Adding a guest: `add`

Adds a guest to the guest list for the purpose of assigning a room +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL [t/TAG] r/ROOM_NUMBER
from/START_DATE to/END_DATE`

[TIP]

* The room number must be a 3-digit number from 001 to 100. For example, 074 is
valid but 128 is not.
* The dates can be expressed in DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY.
* A guest can make an unlimited number of bookings with the hotel, as long as
the booking is valid.

* As of v1.3, you must create your own passwords.json file with your username and passwords.
For demo purposes, go to https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-2/main and copy the passwords.json file there
into the same folder as the Concierge.jar file.
Alternatively, create a new passwords.json and use SHA-256 Hash to generate
the hash for your password. You can use this website for this: https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/

****

** `add`, `edit` [red]#Coming in v2.0#
** `checkin`, `checkout` [red]#Coming in v2.0#

team's GitHub username

[NOTE]
More users can be added at `src/data/passwords.json`. When adding passwords
